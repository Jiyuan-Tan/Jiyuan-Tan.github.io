I am an undergraduate student in Department of Mathematics, Fudan University.

<br />
My research interest lies in data-driven decision making and theoretical analysis of stochastic algorithms.

<br />
I was fortunate to intern in the group of Prof. <a href = "https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/" >Yinyu Ye </a>. Prior to this, I study the Zero-sum Markov game with Prof. <a href = "https://zhaoranwang.github.io/" >Zhaoran Wang </a> and <a href = "https://www.princeton.edu/~zy6/" >Zhuoran Yang </a>.
