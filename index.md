I am an undergraduate student in Department of Mathematics, Fudan University.

My research interest lies in the foundation of deep learning, optimization in machine learning and reinforce learning.

I was fortunate to intern in the group of Prof. [Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/), where I develop a derivative-free solver for general constrained nonlinear optimization. Prior to this, I study the application of RL in Zero-sum game with Prof. [Zhaoran Wang](https://zhaoranwang.github.io/) and [Zhuoran Yang](https://www.princeton.edu/~zy6/).
